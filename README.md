## Rock Paper Scissors

Rock Paper Scissors aimed to be a Computer Vs Player game which was responsive using JavaScript.  The target audience was anybody who likes to play games online.

## Features

Heading - featured at the top of the page is the page heading which identifies what the game is about.


## The Game Area
![Game Area](assets/images/RPSsite.png)

This section provides players with a choice of buttons to pick their move. 

There is an area which should show results e.g. You win! or You lose!

There are player and computer areas in contrasting colours which contain scores for each opponant and shows the start up images which contain all the images which should show during the game

## Rules
There is a rules section contained within the footer of the site which shows players what happens with each choice and how to win. This is in a contrasting colour to the player and computer areas so that it is easily defined.

## Testing

- I tested the page works on different browsers including chrome and safari.
- I tested the site with a HTML Validator (this failed as there were multiple issues)
- I tested the site with a CSS Validator (this passed and showed everything was ok)
- I tested the site with a JavaScript checker (this failed as there were multiple issues)

## Bugs
Basically, my site doesn't do anything that I intended it to do. I have REALLY struggled with Javascript. I've tried to have mentor meetings which didn't happen (I was given a mentor on the other side of the world who's schedule clashed with mine and then when I did stay up late to meet, I wasn't provided details on how to enter the meeting, the meeting was pointless as I had limited time left in the booking and when I was provided a new mentor it was too close to the deadline).

So I've struggled with this on my own, tried to search the internet for guidance and basically floundered about and I know the project will fail at this point.

## validator testing
- html - multiple errors were returned when passed through the official w3C validator.
- css - no errors were returned when passed through the official jigsaw validator.
- accessibility - I checked that colours and fonts chosen were easy to read and accessible by running it through lighthouse.

## unfixed bugs
there are multiple unfixed bugs. I decided not to fix them given the time I had left AND the fact I knew I would fail as my JavaScript elements didn't work

## deployment
The site was deployed to github pages
the steps to deploy are as follows:
  - in the github repository click on deployments on the right hand side
  - when the new screen opens click on the open link in new tab button next to the top deployment

## credits
When coding the site I used a range of websites to troubleshoot problems I came across and ended up typing code from places to see if it worked, I often had to amend this to make it fit my design and ensure it worked for my project. Sites i looked at included w3schools and Stackoverflow. 

I used code elements shown from the walkthrough project and also the briefing video such as the FontAwesom and Google Fonts links for styling the page.

I took my images from the following PNG which I found on the internet (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Rock_paper_scissors_lizard_spock.svg)
